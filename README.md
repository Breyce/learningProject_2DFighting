## Development Day 1: 2023.10.18

For my second Unity project, I also followed an online tutorial. This time, I'm working on a 2D platformer game. Since I have a game concept in mind that shares a similar game mechanic in the future, I want to build up my technical skills now. After completing the small project of Plants vs. Zombies, I have a basic understanding of Unity, so this tutorial didn't prove to be too challenging on my first day of development. Given the daily academic pressures, I only allocate a portion of my time each day to work on these projects â€“ there's also the need to study for my thesis, graphics, and machine learning-related subjects.

I have to say, a good tutorial is indeed crucial. When the instructor's approach is clear, their code is well-structured, and their knowledge of Unity is deep, the quality of their teaching is exceptionally high. This time, the instructor has made me feel comfortable and provided clear guidance compared to the instructor from the first tutorial. I have learned a lot from following this instructor and taken plenty of notes. Here are some of the specific topics I covered (excluding detailed content):

1. I learned about the relevant parameters and functions of **Rigidbody** in Unity, as well as the differences between Box Collider and Capsule Collider. I also learned why Capsule Collider is often preferred.
1. I learned how to access and manipulate objects in Unity's engine through code. Previously, I only knew that I could search for objects within the game entities, but today I learned that I can directly assign the relevant entities by dragging and dropping them into the public variables in the corresponding script. Of course, I still prefer the flexibility and versatility of accessing entities through code because it's not limited to public variables. However, this operation has given me a clearer understanding of Unity's engine workflow.
1. I learned that in Unity, you can directly access key information by using the name associated with a bound key. For example, if the "space" key is bound to "Jump," you can use `GetButtonDown("Jump")` to check whether the space key is pressed. This significantly improves development efficiency. You can find the specific configuration in the corresponding options within the Project Manager.
1. I also learned about the significance of layers in Unity. We added a new layer, and these layers have a specific rendering order, starting from layer 0, with each new layer placed above all the previous layers. This mechanism helps us efficiently manage the development order of 2D games without having to worry about adjusting the entire layer order when adding new entities.
